## Visual Flow Frontend

##### Process Overview

Visual Flow jobs and pipelines exist within a certain namespace (project) so the first step in the application would be to create a project or enter existing project. Then you need to enter Job Designer to create a job.

##### JobDesigner

Job designer is a graphical design interface used to create, maintain,execute and analyze jobs. Each job determines the data sources, the required transformations and destination of the data.
Designing a pipeline is similar to designing a job.

##### PipelineDesigner

Pipeline designer is a graphical design interface aimed for managing pipelines.

Visual Flow key functions include but not limited to 

- Create project which serves as a namespace for jobs and/or pipelines
- Manage project settings
- User access management
- Create/maintain a job in Job Designer
- Job execution and logs analysis
- Create/maintain a pipeline in Pipeline Designer
- Pipeline execution
- Import/Export jobs and pipelines

##### Roles and authorizations

The following roles are available in the application:

- Viewer
- Operator
- Editor
- Administrator

They can perform the below operations within the namespaces they are authorized to.
Only Super-admin user can create a workspace (project) and grant access to this project.
